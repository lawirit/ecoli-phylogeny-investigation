# Phylogenetic Investigation of the 2011 *E. coli* O104:H4 Outbreak Strain

## Objective

As a scientist specializing in the 2011 *E. coli* O104:H4 outbreak, the goal of this project is to conduct and document a preliminary phylogenetic analysis. The purpose is to place the outbreak strain within the broader evolutionary tree of *Enteroaggregative *E. coli* (EAEC) and Shiga-toxin producing *E. coli* (STEC) to better understand its potential genetic origin. This task simulates a reproducible bioinformatics workflow, from data acquisition to analysis and reporting, using GitHub's collaborative tools.

## Methodology

*Placeholder for description of data sources, alignment tool, tree construction method.*

## Results

*Placeholder for text-based representation of phylogenetic tree and interpretation of topology.*

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains genomic sequences in FASTA format.
- `run_alignment.py`: Python script to perform multiple sequence alignment.
- `build_tree.py`: Python script to construct phylogenetic tree.
- `alignment.aln`: Output alignment file.
- `phylogeny.tree`: Output phylogenetic tree in Newick format.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Workflow

1. Curate a comparative genomic dataset (Issue #1).
2. Develop a multiple sequence alignment script (Issue #2).
3. Develop a phylogenetic tree construction script (Issue #3).
4. Finalize and document the analysis (Issue #4).

All steps are managed via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
